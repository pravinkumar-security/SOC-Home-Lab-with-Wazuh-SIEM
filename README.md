# üõ°Ô∏è SOC Home Lab Using Wazuh SIEM 

This project is a self-built **Security Operations Center (SOC)** home lab using the **Wazuh SIEM** platform. It simulates a real-world SIEM environment where logs are collected, analyzed, and responded to using automation techniques such as **VirusTotal integration** and **Active Response**.  

Designed to demonstrate **end-to-end SOC processes** ‚Äî from agent deployment to file monitoring and threat response ‚Äî this lab showcases hands-on skills in **incident detection**, **response automation**, and **log analysis**.

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies Used  
- **Wazuh SIEM** (Manager & Agents)  
- **Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS** (Wazuh Manager)  
- **Windows 10** (Agent)

## üß© Project Structure & Workflow  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Wazuh Manager Installation (Ubuntu Server)  
- Installed Wazuh Manager on a dedicated Ubuntu Server.  
- Set up the Wazuh Dashboard, Filebeat, and Elasticsearch stack.  
- Verified the dashboard is accessible and logs are ingested successfully.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Agent Deployment  
- Deployed and registered two agents with the manager:  
  - **Ubuntu Agent** (Linux endpoint)  
  - **Windows Agent** (Windows 10 endpoint)  
- Verified agent connectivity and event forwarding to the Wazuh Manager.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)  
**Windows Agent:**  
- Configured to monitor a specific file for unauthorized changes.  
- All file changes (e.g., edits, deletions) are captured and displayed on the Wazuh Dashboard in real time.  

**Ubuntu Agent:**  
- Monitored critical directories (e.g., `/etc`, `/var/log`) for integrity violations.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ VirusTotal Integration on Wazuh Server  
- Installed and configured VirusTotal integration on the **Ubuntu Wazuh Manager**.  
- Developed and deployed a script that:  
  - Scans suspicious files or hashes using the VirusTotal API.  
  - Parses the results to identify potential malware.  
- Enabled **Active Response**, allowing the Wazuh Manager to:  
  - Automatically trigger the script when a malicious file or hash is detected.  
  - Take remediation actions like file deletion or alert escalation.  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Dashboard Exploration & Log Analysis  
- Explored the Wazuh Dashboard modules:  
  - Security Events  
  - FIM Logs  
  - Agent Status & Performance  
  - Syscheck & Rootcheck  
  - VirusTotal Alerts & Active Response logs  
- Monitored real-time alerts, reviewed triggered rules, and verified response actions.
